    "text": "Preface\nFeynman diagrams are one of those things that seemingly have one purpose, but actually hide a deeper one. For professional physicists, a Feynman Diagram is a very complex instruction on how to assemble the flow of a reaction or a decay according to the rules of quantum mechanics. There are two ways to do this: the hard way and the less-hard way. The hard way is a laborious and fragile calculational setup, followed by a laborious and complicated calculation of the actual process. The easy way is to draw the Feynman Diagram and then do the second, laborious and complicated calculation.\nBut perhaps accidentally, but at least fortunately Feynman Diagrams are instructive as a pattern. They appear to look like the reaction itself. ewfDS",
